            </p>
            <p>
                The Service Provider does not facilitate currency exchange transactions, broker currency trades, provide

        <section>
            <h2>2. No Guarantee of Accuracy</h2>
            <p>
                The exchange rates provided by the Application are dynamic and may vary between different regions and
                over time. Due to the volatile nature of currency markets, the information presented in the Application
                may not always be accurate, complete, or up to date. Users are advised to verify the authenticity of any
                financial information and consult with a qualified professional before engaging in any currency trading
                or investment activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the Service Provider endeavors to provide accurate and timely information, it makes no guarantees
                regarding the precision, reliability, or completeness of the data. Under no circumstances shall the
                Service Provider be liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential loss or damage arising from the
                use or inability to use the information in the Application.

                Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of the Application complies with all local,
                national, and international laws and regulations. Any user conducting unauthorized or unlawful

                entirely at their own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Service Provider shall not be held liable for any governmental or regulatory actions taken against

                access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your
                phone, which involves removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating
                system of your device. Such actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
                compromise your phone’s security features, and may result in the Application not functioning correctly
                or at all.
